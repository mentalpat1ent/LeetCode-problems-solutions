119. Pascal's Triangle II

Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:

        if rowIndex == 0:
            return [1]

        n = 1
        current_length = 2
        previous_row = [1, 1]

        while n != rowIndex:
            current_length += 1
            row = [1] * current_length
            for i in range(1, current_length - 1):
                row[i] = previous_row[i] + previous_row[i - 1]
                
            previous_row = row[::]

            n += 1
            
        return previous_row

```
