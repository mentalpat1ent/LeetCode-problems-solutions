1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency

Python Solution
```
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # Get the frequency of the elements inside nums
        freq = Counter(nums)
        new_freq = {}
        result = []

        # Iterate through the frequency of the elements and if there are elements with
        # the same frequency we add them in a list and the key of the new freq dictionary
        # will be the frequencies of the elements
        for key in freq:

            # If the frequecny is not in the dictionary we initialize it with an empty list
            if freq[key] not in new_freq:

            # We add the element with it's corresponding frequency
            new_freq[freq[key]].append(key)
        
        # Sort the new frequency dictionary by its keys
        keys = list(new_freq.keys())
        keys.sort()

        for key in keys:

            # If there are more elements with the same frequency we sort them in a decreasing order
            if len(new_freq[key]) > 1:
                result += sorted(new_freq[key] * key, reverse = True)
            else:
