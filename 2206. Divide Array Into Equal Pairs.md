2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs

Python Solution
```
class Solution:
    def divideArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        # Frequency dictionary using Counter function
        freq = Counter(nums)

        # Iterate through the frequency of the elements
        for frequency in freq.values():

            # If there is a frequency that is odd it means that we cannot divide nums into n pairs
            if frequency % 2 != 0:
                return False
        
        return True
```
